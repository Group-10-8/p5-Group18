* Story number and name: 1 – Extend User Profile Detail With Usage
* Story points: 3
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* - Navigate to any user’s detail page (Users → select a user).
* - The profile displays two usage indicators:
*     - Most recently uploaded photo (thumbnail + upload date)
*     - Photo with the most comments (thumbnail + total comment count)
* - Clicking either thumbnail opens the User Photos view with that exact photo 
*   selected and all its comments visible.
*
* Story number and name: 5 – Deleting Comments, Photos, and Users
* Story points: 4
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* - On the User Photos page:
*     - A user may delete any photo they own.
*     - A user may delete any comment they have written, even on photos owned by others.
* - From the User Detail page:
*     - A user may delete their entire account (with a required confirmation).
* - Account deletion removes:
*     - The User object
*     - All photos owned by the user (including their image files on disk)
*     - All comments written by the user anywhere in the system
*     - The user’s session (automatically logs the user out)
*
* Story number and name: 8 – Sidebar List Marks Users With New Activity
* Story points: 3
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* - The sidebar user list shows each user's most recent activity, which may be:
*     - posted a photo (includes a thumbnail)
*     - added a comment
*     - registered
*     - logged in
*     - logged out
* - Each activity shows a timestamp.
* - The list automatically refreshes every 10 seconds so recent activity appears 
*   without page reload.
*
* Story number and name: 10 – Photo Stepper
* Story points: 3
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* - Navigate to a user’s Photos page.
* - Only one photo is displayed at a time along with all its comments.
* - Use the Previous and Next buttons to navigate through the photos.
*     - Buttons disable when at the first or last photo.
* - The URL updates to include ?photoId=<id> so that:
*     - Individual photos are bookmarkable and sharable
*     - Browser back/forward buttons correctly navigate between photos
*     - Opening a deep link loads the correct photo and updates the stepper position
*
* Story number and name: 13 – Login and Browser Refresh
* Story points: 3
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* - After logging in, a user may refresh the browser and stay logged in, using 
*   persistent server-side sessions.
* - On page load, the app calls /session to restore the logged-in user.
* - Behavior is backward compatible with Mocha tests and does not compromise security.
*
* Total Story Points: (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 16
*
* Any special instructions for grading (it should be easy for someone to run 
* your app from a new machine):
* 
* To run the application on a new machine:
* - Start MongoDB locally (mongodb://127.0.0.1/project5).
* - Run:
*       npm install
*       npm start
* - Images are stored in the /images directory and are created automatically on upload.
